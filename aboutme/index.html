<h2>Sumner Brandt</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Sumner Brandt. I've lived in Missouri my whole life 
with my family of 7. I have 2 brothers, 2 sisters, and 2 loving parents.
Idaho has been really different, strange, and exciting so far.
This is definitely the most snow I've ever seen.</p>
<p>I don't have any experience coding so all this has been a lot to keep up with,
but it's also been very fun thus far. I've been homeschooled by my mother most of my life, and 
spending so much time at home I've picked up quite a few odd hobbies like unicyling,
juggling, and speed cubing. I love to bake, watch movies and play video games.</p>
<p>I've been a member of the church my whole life, and I love God and the second
chance he continues to give me every day.</p>
<p>I'm very excited to meet all of you guys in person!</p>
